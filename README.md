# Knowledge_Graph_Notes

## Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph of OSNs ₲ is a tuple ₲ = (U, E, T) where 

- U represents a group of users
- E ⊆ U × U represents a group of edges between users
	- Represents that there is a trust relationship between users. 
	- Edge in knowledge graph are represented as triples(h,r,t), head has a relation with tail. 
- The value of trust relationship we call trust value, denoted as t(𝑣, 𝑒,𝑢), is direct, because of v and u are connected directly by the edge e. 
- A is connected to B directly with a trust value 0.76, which can be denoted as (A, 0.76, B).
